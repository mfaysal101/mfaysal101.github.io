I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. My research focuses are on parallel and distributed computing, graph algorithms, machine architecture, and HPC performance modeling. I am also a graduate affiliate with the Computer Architecture Group (CAG) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

I started my Ph.D. program in Computer Science (CS) at the University of New Orleans (UNO) in 2017. I obtained my M.S. in CS in the year 2020 from UNO. I attended my Ph.D. program in CS at UNO until the spring of 2022 before transferring to the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) in the fall of 2022. My Ph.D. research includes parallel and distributed algorithm design using HPC for information-theoretic community discovery for social network analysis, protein clustering in biological networks, and k-truss-based local community discovery for goal-oriented community search. Since 2020, I have been working as a graduate intern and graduate affiliate with the Computer Architecture Group (CAG) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). There I have been an active contributor to the DOE-funded project for Advanced Scientific Computing Research: Co-Design for Exascale computing. This role has expanded the area of my research in performance modeling of the massive-scale graph and genomics applications in the HPC platforms (NERSC Cori, Perlmutter, etc.), software-hardware co-design in heterogeneous computer architecture, and validation of theoretical performance models against true performance.

I completed my undergraduate program in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2014. I worked as a software engineer at ReliSource Technologies Ltd. from 2014 to 2017 before starting my Ph.D. program. Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy hiking, long-drive, and playing cricket, badminton, and soccer.
