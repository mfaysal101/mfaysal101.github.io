I am a recent Ph.D. graduate (Fall 2023) in Computer Science (CS) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. My research focuses are on parallel and distributed computing, graph algorithms, High-Performance Computing (HPC) machine architecture, and HPC performance modeling. I am also a graduate affiliate with the Computer Architecture Group (CAG) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).

I started my Ph.D. program in Computer Science at the University of New Orleans (UNO) in 2017. I obtained my M.S. in CS in the year 2020 from UNO. I attended UNO for my Ph.D. program in CS until the Spring of 2022. Then I transferred to the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) as a Ph.D. candidate in CS in the Fall of 2022. My Ph.D. research includes parallel and distributed algorithm design using HPC for information-theoretic community discovery for social and biological networks analysis, design and simulation of HPC accelerator for fast hash accumulation, and novel parallel algorithm design for k-truss-based goal-oriented community discovery. I have been awarded summer research internships during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 with the CAG group at Berkeley Lab (LBNL) and a graduate affiliate with the same group during the regular semesters. There I have been an active contributor to the DOE and NSA collaborative project for Advanced Scientific Computing Research: software-hardware co-design and exploration of novel computing architecture. This role has expanded the area of my research in performance modeling of the massive-scale graph and genomics applications in the HPC platforms (NERSC Cori, Perlmutter, etc.), software-hardware co-design in heterogeneous computer architecture, and validation of theoretical performance models against true performance.

I completed my undergraduate program in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2014. Then I worked as a software engineer at ReliSource Technologies Ltd. from 2014 to 2017 before starting my Ph.D. program at UNO. Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy hiking, long drives, and playing cricket, badminton, and soccer.
